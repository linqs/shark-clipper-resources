# Shark Clipper Resources

Resources used in the build of [Shark Clipper](https://github.com/linqs/shark-clipper).

## FFmpeg

Shark Clipper bundles binaries of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) with it.
In this repo, we will house the binaries that will be fetched/bundled during build time.
These binaries come from other sources.
We did not build these binaries and are not responsible for any unintended code built into them.

See the [scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.py](scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.py) script for the exact sources.
